Currently the bin files are created by programs in util/.

rom.bin loads head 0 / track 0 / sector 0 from the A drive into memory
at address 0100h and jumps to it.

a_drive.bin is a disk image for the A drive with heads=1, tracks=1,
sectors=1.  The only sector contains a program (org 0100h) that prints
'Hello, World!'  on the console and halts.
